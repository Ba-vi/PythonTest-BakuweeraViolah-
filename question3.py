# Question 3(i)
#  Write a Python program that prompts a user to enter numbers. The process will repeat until
#  the user enters 0. Finally, the program prints sum of the numbers entered by the user.

#solution
def sum_of_numbers():
        numbers = int(input("Enter the numbers : "))
        numbers.repeat
        print(f"number")
        sum = 0
        total_sum =[numbers]
        for sums in total_sum:
         sum+=numbers
        print("sums")






# Question 3(ii)
# Write a Python program to print all the numbers from 1 to 100 that are not divisible by 2

#solution
number = int(input("Enter numbers from 1-100: "))
numbers = number % 2 

if numbers == 0:
    value = numbers+1
    print(value)
else:
    print("Enter another number.")
