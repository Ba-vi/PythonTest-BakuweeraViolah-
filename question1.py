# Question 1(i)
# Write a Python program to find the distance between two coordinate points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

#solution
x1=int(input("Enter the x1 coordinate: "))
x2=int(input("Enter the x2 coordinate: "))
y1=int(input("Enter the y1 coordinate: "))
y2=int(input("Enter the y2 coordinate: "))
import math
distance= ((x2-x1**2) + (y2-y1)**2)**1/2
print(f"The distance between the coordinates is : {distance}")





# Question 1(ii)
# Write a Python program to find maximum between three numbers.

# solution
def maximum():
    first_number=int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    second_number=int(input("Enter the second number:  "))
    third_number=int(input("Enter the third number:  "))
    maximum = maximum["first_number","second_number","third_number"]
    print(f"The maximum between the three numbers is : {maximum}")
maximum()
